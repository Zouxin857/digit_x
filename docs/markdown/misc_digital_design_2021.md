**The Department of Architecture is a unique community, rich in diversity, collaboration, and scholarship through design. Here, students explore today’s most creative design approaches, with an international faculty prominent across the field.**

Together with visiting design critics and theorists from around the world, architecture faculty and students explore a range of design investigations, expand knowledge, and confront the challenges of the contemporary built environment. Collaboration thrives in Gund Hall’s distinctive trays, five continuous tiers of open studio space.

The Department’s philosophy of design excellence integrates the imaginative and skillful manipulation of form, as well as the ability to draw inspiration from a broad body of knowledge. The architecture curriculum includes design studio, theory, visual studies, history, `technology`, and professional practice, with design as the central focus of instruction.

Gund Hall’s studio trays form both the physical and pedagogical core of the GSD experience, drawing together students and faculty from across the departments of architecture, landscape architecture, and urban planning and design. The creative, collaborative atmosphere of the trays is supplemented by Gund Hall’s advanced information infrastructure, media-enriched presentation spaces, vast library resources, and open access to fabrication technologies, enabling architecture students to develop, discuss, exchange, and materialize ideas through a comprehensive range of platforms and media. The student experience is further enriched by the School’s renowned lecture and public program series, exhibitions, and publications, as well as the resources available across Harvard University and the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Students in the Department of Architecture are integrated into an active network of internationally recognized designers, dedicated to addressing the changing needs of the modern world.

As new ways of thinking emerge in the profession of architecture, the field grows increasingly complex and requires new techniques of inquiry and design. For generations, the GSD has educated committed individuals who have assumed leadership roles in shaping the built environment. Today’s graduates in architecture continue this tradition by pioneering new design approaches to the challenges posed by contemporary society.

**The Department of Landscape Architecture at Harvard is home to the oldest and most distinguished academic program in landscape architecture in the world. Its mission is to advance research and innovative design practices in the natural and built environments, as they intersect with processes of urbanization and the present realities of a changing climate.**

ince its founding in 1900, it has played a singular role in the development of landscape architecture as a profession, an academic discipline, and as a medium of design that engages urbanism, environmentalism, and culture. The mission of Landscape Architecture at Harvard is to advance research and innovative design practices in the natural and built environments, as they intersect with processes of urbanization and the urgent challenges posed by a changing climate, including widespread environmental and social inequities. Candidates in the Master in Landscape Architecture (MLA) Program work with an internationally recognized faculty, and explore the multiple ways that landscapes positively contribute to the complexities of the contemporary city, to a more equitable distribution of ecological and environmental resources, and to the creation of better futures across all regions of the world.

As the challenges of the built environment rarely correspond to traditional disciplinary boundaries, coursework in the MLA Program spans the depth and breadth of the field and enjoys strong pedagogical connections to urban planning, urban design, and architecture. MLA candidates enjoy access to and engagement with the extra-Departmental assets of the Graduate School of Design including a robust calendar of lectures, exhibitions, and events attendant to current design culture across disciplines as well as the Advanced Studies Programs, the Aga Khan Program, the Joint Center for Housing Studies, and the Loeb Fellowship. MLA candidates benefit from proximity to events and discussions in cognate disciplines across campus in the history of art and architecture, ecology, engineering, environment, and the arts. The Department’s coursework and culture are leavened by a range of institutional assets and resources unique in the discipline including the Harvard Forest, the Arnold Arboretum, the Harvard Center for the Environment, and Dumbarton Oaks.

Landscape architecture today enjoys greater cultural relevance, public visibility, and potential for professional leadership than at any time in recent history. The Department has been among the most significant centers in the world for the production and dissemination of landscape knowledge. The Department aspires to be the preeminent venue for the education of landscape architects as they are increasingly called upon as design professionals uniquely capable of representing and responding to the challenges found at the intersection of design culture, urbanization and environment.

**It was at Harvard University that the first formal North American programs in city and regional planning (1923) and urban design (1960) were established. Since then, Harvard has played a leading role in the education of urban planners and urban designers. The Department of Urban Planning and Design is home to both professions, offering a professional degree in urban planning and a post-professional degree in urban design.**

Composed of internationally experienced scholars and practitioners, the Department’s faculty explores the built environment from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and points of view. The Department’s pedagogically innovative combination of interdisciplinary studios, lecture courses, seminars, and independent study, coupled with a relatively small student size of roughly 180 individuals drawn from around the world, creates an intimate, engaged educational atmosphere in which students thrive and learn.

Students take full advantage of the curricular and extracurricular offerings of the GSD’s Department of Architecture and Department of Landscape Architecture. The Department of Urban Planning and Design also draws upon the significant resources of Harvard University as a whole. The Urban Planning program administers joint degree programs with the Kennedy School, the Law School, and the School of Public Health. Students often cross-register in courses offered by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Business School, the Kennedy School, the Law School, and the School of Public Health. Students also cross-register in courses offered by the neighboring Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Planners today have access to unprecedented amounts of data on the built environment and the people who use it. These data come from a wide variety of sources ranging from traditional administrative data and survey data to emerging sources of passively-collected and crowdsourced data. By then end of this course, `you will be able to confidently navigate unfamiliar datasets and create information that you can use to (1) improve your own understanding of places and spatial phenomena at the national, regional, and neighborhood scales and (2) communicate your ideas and conclusions to others. You will learn to create figures and maps that are appropriate for inclusion in reports, posters, and web-based presentations. `

This course is an introduction to fundamental concepts, techniques, and methods related to digital media in architecture and design, `with a focus on reciprocal processes of translation between digital media and material artifacts.` It examines how digital technologies mediate our interaction with the physical environment, critically engages the capacities and limitations of select computational processes and investigates the latent design opportunities embedded in each one.

This semester we will structure our investigation around the notion of the model as a means of addressing broader questions related to the role of digital media in architecture and design. `Whether a digital entity, physical artifact or something in-between, the model can be considered as an instrument for the development, prototyping and representation of architecture, as well as a discrete design artifact to be evaluated on its own terms.` The plurality of design approaches and working methods afforded by the postdigital has blurred the role of models within experimental architectural practice. Accordingly, we position the contemporary model not as a singular entity but as an amalgamation of multiple models, each tailored to inform the design process, instrumentalized to act on the world, and evaluable via its own unique criteria.

`Our exploration will be categorized into four sequential thematic areas – digitization, simulation, materialization, and visualization. `Each thematic area will act as a lens through which to reconsider the role and agency of the model.  Lectures, readings, and in-class discussions will situate the model within a theoretical and historical context. `Digital processes including photogrammetric 3D scanning, animation, physics-based simulation, texture mapping, interactive visualization, along with select digital and analog fabrication processes, will be introduced via a series of workshops. `

The course will address the content described above through a combination of lectures, discussions, technical workshops, and design exercises. Typically, each session will be divided into a lecture half and a workshop half. `Technical workshops will introduce software including Rhino/Grasshopper (along with its associated plugins for analysis, simulation, and animation), Autodesk Recap (photogrammetry), Cinema 4D (rendering, simulation, animation) and Unity (interactive visualization, first-person navigation) `All software utilized in the class is either available for educational use via the GSD or open source.

The presented concepts and techniques will be explored through a semester-long project organized into a sequential set of assignments. Beginning with the process of photogrammetric 3D scanning, students will explore a variety of modeling and form-making strategies using a collection of digital and fabrication tools. Subsequent assignments will explore the affordances of specific modeling techniques and examine the relationship of the presented technique to architectural concerns including scale, materiality, originality, and authorship. Each assignment will invite opportunities for scalar translation, ranging from 1:1 to scaleless to various scales over physical and digital models with focus on reciprocal materiality, structure, and organization changes. For the final project, participants will work in small groups to utilize the workflows presented in class in a collaborative design exercise.  Anticipated costs include materials for two physical modeling exercises, executed in groups, at the midterm and final reviews.

<a href="https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/course/philosophy-of-technology-from-marx-and-heidegger-to-ai-genome-editing-and-geoengineering-hks-fall-2021/"><img src="./imgs_/misc_a/008.jpg" height="auto" width="auto" title="digit-x"></a>

Technology shapes how power is exercised in society, and thereby also changes how the present changes into the future. Technological innovation is all around us, and new possibilities in fields like artificial intelligence, genome-editing and geoengineering not only reallocate power, but might transform human life considerably, to the point of modifying the essence of what it is to be human. Basic attitudes towards technology vary considerably. At times it is tech optimism that dominates the debates (sometimes even a techno-boosterism that sees technology as key to heaven on earth), and at other times it is more low-spirited attitudes ranging from romantic uneasiness to doom-and-gloom Luddism and technology-bashing. A closer look at these various attitudes – and reflection on how technology and power are intertwined — will help generate a more skeptical attitude towards all of them and contribute to a more level-headed debate, which is so badly needed. While ethical considerations will enter prominently, the philosophy of technology is broader than its ethics. It aims to interpret and critically assess the role of technology for human life and guide us to a more thoughtful integration of technology in our individual lives and in public decision making.  **This course aims to teach you to do just that, starting with basic stances and key figures in the field and then progressing towards challenges around technology as they will arise for the 21st century.**

<a href="https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/course/dynamic-digital-landforms-fall-2021/"><img src="./imgs_/misc_a/009.jpg" height="auto" width="auto" title="digit-x"></a>

The course will explore nascent digital techniques of modelling, simulation, analysis, and visualisation of the landscape as a dynamic system, and speculate on the role of emerging sensing and responsive technologies to generate recursive relationships between computation and ecology. The intention is to examine and frame new approaches to land-forming, and the making of new environments not prioritised as extensions of humans, but rather as new configurations that include, and re-value, non-human agents.

The landscape, considered as both form and process, is a palimpsest of conditional processes and properties, one that is open-ended, flexible, and adaptable, displaying a self-organizing uncertainty and dynamism. It is defined and shaped by a collection of material processes that reflect dynamic ecological, economic, social, and technological conditions. The resultant formal composition of these phenomena inherently describes the forces that have shaped them, and that will continue to do so, in which form translates the material registration of force as ‘a network of enveloped material processes.’ 

The sensed landscape creates reciprocal relationships between dynamic material conditions that shift the perception of matter to information. Questions that will be pursued include; how might the agency of this technology inform new ways of shaping the morphology of the landscape in response to issues of climate change; what generative sequences that shape the land and its processes can be developed; and what conceptual shifts might this propagate? 

**Experiments with digital techniques and methods will build on these concepts to generate innovative, imaginative, and measurable digital representations for the translation and visualisation of landscape systems as landform, process, and phenomena. This will be conducted as an iterative design process interrogating how we might perceive change in a landscape system and consequently new ways to engage with it.** This investigation will be defined through the constraints of space that examine material and form, in relationship to modalities of time.

This is a project-based seminar framed through 3 parts. In part 01 we will explore the agency of sensor and responsive technologies through lectures, guest lectures, readings, precedent studies, and class discussion. The intention is to define new conceptual frameworks of the dynamic landscape. Digital simulation techniques will be explored in part 02 through demonstrations that explore the visualisation and representation of change over time. In part 03, we will develop a final project that brings together the conceptual positions developed in part 01, and the techniques of part 02, as a digital model that describes the structural design of a complex landscape system.

The course aims to contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between architecture and construction through the study of key historical episodes such as the rise of modern tectonic ideals in the 18th century, the development of iron and concrete buildings, the 20th-century quest for light structures, or more recent developments in materials, structure and building technologies. The course will also raise theoretical questions such as what the terms material and structure truly mean, or how does architecture differ from mere construction. Beyond its historical and theoretical scope, the ambition of the course is also to foster students' reflection on the contemporary evolution of the relationship between architecture and construction. Indeed, the rise of digital technologies and more recently the development of strong environmental concerns challenge our received understanding of tectonics, materials, and ultimately design.

The course will consist of live lectures given online followed discussions. Lectures will be recorded and made accessible to the students of the course. Apart from regular attendance, the students will be asked to produce a short end-of-the-semester paper on a topic related to the course.

**This course introduces students to quantitative analysis and research methods for urban planning.** The course begins with an examination of how quantitative methods fit within the broader analytic landscape. It then exposes students to basic descriptive statistics (including measures of central tendency and dispersion), principles of statistical inference, and a wide variety of analytic methods and their practical application. **By the end of the course, students will be comfortable with many analytic techniques relevant to urban planning and policy, including: z-tests, t-tests, ANOVA, chi square tests, correlation, and multivariate regression.** On a broader level, students will gain the ability to understand and critically question the kinds of analyses and representations of quantitative data encountered in urban planning and allied disciplines.

**The aim of the course is to introduce students to key concepts and tools in quantitative analysis and research.** Most importantly, however, the goal is to develop students’ intuition regarding data analysis and the application of statistical techniques. By the end of the course, students will be familiar with how common techniques of quantitative analysis can be applied to a wide variety of data. Students will also gain a sense of the strengths and weaknesses of quantitative data analysis and under what circumstances the tools learned in the class are best applied in practice. The course seeks to train technically competent, intellectually critical practitioners and scholars who are able to apply quantitative methods in a wide range of settings, and who are also aware of the wider analytic context into which these approaches fit. There is a focus throughout the course on epistemology and the ethics of claim-making. Over the course, students will deepen their understanding of how claims are made, how claims are connected to different forms of evidence, and what makes different kinds of claims credible.

How can planners understand places in a rich, meaningful, and yet systematic way? This module examines how qualitative approaches can be used in planning practice and research. Qualitative methods are particularly useful in answering why and how questions; investigating differing perceptions and values; understanding unique situations; and helping describe complex situations.

**Focused on learning-by-doing, the class examines how to design a qualitative research project and reviews a range of data collection and analysis methods useful in community and organizational environments.** With the aid of well-thought-out conceptual frameworks, qualitative research can be designed to make a coherent and meaningful argument. Students learn about collecting and reviewing artifacts, observing places, asking questions, engaging with diverse groups, and using visual techniques. Such data are frequently organized into specific kinds of outputs including case studies, scenarios, and evaluations. Students will try out these approaches in weekly exercises.

**Digital design and fabrication technologies have become integral to the discourse surrounding contemporary design and architectural practice.** The translation from design to realization is mediated by a range of tools and processes whose development is informed over time by material properties, skill, technology, and culture. As a whole, these systems are the vehicle by which design teams, manufacturers, installers, and ultimately users engage the materiality of architecture. Parallel technological developments relating to the way in which things are designed (digital modeling, simulation, generative design, etc.) and the way things are made (automation, computer-controlled equipment including robotics, advanced materials, etc.) have afforded new opportunities and challenges related to the realization of new forms in architecture, part customization, user-centered design, and enhanced building performance.

Within this context, this year’s course positions ceramic material systems as a vehicle for exploring applied research methodologies and investigation into the opportunities (and challenges) afforded by digital fabrication techniques. Building on nearly a decade of research by the Material Processes and Systems (MaP+S) group at the GSD and long-time collaboration with the Harvard Ceramics Studio in Allston (with Kathy King), **this course will advance strategies for robotics, additive manufacturing, and other computational fabrication technologies.** Ceramics are the first material created by humankind and are produced across scales and applications from the craft studio to high-volume, automated manufacturing environments. Easily manipulated by hand, it can just as easily be subject to digital technologies and robotic approaches. While ceramic-specific aspects of material design and manipulation will be taught, emphasis is on understanding ceramics as a microcosm of material research that offers insights that transfer to work with almost any material used in architecture.

The course includes weekly lectures (including guests from related industries and practice), discussions, and hands-on workshops. Lectures include a historic overview of material systems, fundamentals of fabrication and manufacturing, strategic customization, digital and physical prototyping, digital simulation, introduction to robotic systems, introduction to product development, production economics, research methods, and other topics. Selected readings of book chapters and papers will supplement topics taught in class. Technical workshops will introduce core concepts in machine design, microelectronics, motion control, kinematics, and material processes. **Students will be introduced to a range of digital fabrication and robotic systems, and their related software environments and digital techniques.**

The technical and systems knowledge imparted in the class will be complemented by the teaching of research methods in the technology area, through a combination of readings and writing exercises. Emphasis will be placed on developing sound research methods within areas of design computation, digital fabrication, and related material processes. The course encourages a hands-on, experimental approach to digital making, from the design and fabrication of a custom machine to empirical testing of novel material processes.  There are no prerequisites for this course, only a willingness for open experimentation and critical evaluation of the presented processes and tools.

#GSD6338 is an introductory course on Computational Design, with a particular focus on architecture, landscape and urbanism.
 
**In this course, we will understand "Computational Design" as the set of methods borrowed from fields such as computer science, mathematics, and geometry, applied to solving design problems.** Chances are that a significant portion of your typical design workflow is mediated by digital tools and, in particular, computer software that has been designed and created by a third party, and therefore, your creativity is partially biased by someone else's opinions. However, the real craftsman is the one who understands their tools so well that they can change, improve and adapt them to their own desires. **In this course, you will learn how to think algorithmically, and how to understand and create computer software, so that you will be able to explore new creative opportunities and relate them to your personal interests.**

The course will be conducted as a mix of lectures, hands-on workshops and sections that will introduce you to the conceptual and technical foundations of Computational Design.  Coursework will be a blend of focused technical exercises and open-ended assignments, culminating in a final project of your choice at the end of the semester.

Basic knowledge of **Grasshopper** is strongly desired although not required; if you feel you do not meet this requirement, you will be required the first week to follow a series of tutorials and complete a small exercise. Additionally, previous knowledge of computer programming is NOT required; this is part of what you will learn in this course.

If you are interested in getting a better glimpse of what the course will look like, you can check previous years' lectures on http://bit.ly/GSD6338-Fall2019. Additionally, you can also check work by course alumni on https://gsd6338.org/.

**Research Areas**

**Architecture Representation and Computation**

Principal researcher: Takehiko Nagakura
Founded in 1996, the Architecture Representation and Computation Group sponsors a wide range of education and research activities to students and visiting scholars at MIT's Department of Architecture. The group's challenge is innovative use of computation for solving problems stemmed in contexts of architectural design practice. Current projects encompass software and hardware development, computer graphics content creation, and design work for architectural competitions and building projects.

**Composite Architectures** 

Prof. Mark Goulthorpe is looking to combine digital design and fabrication logics with composite material processing to bring forwards a highly automated and lightweight base-building methodology. This looks to radically streamlining current building-procurement logic via a highly automated and unitary fabrication process, and to attain very environmentally benign yet highly resilient building envelopes and structures. This work is being carried out by a network of academic and industry partners, looking to validate performance (structural design and testing by Mark Bishop, fire engineering and testing by Prof Nick Dempsey at WPI, environmental assessment by Prof Mike Lepech at Stanford). The goal is to prove-up such new base-building technology via prototypes and pilot projects, and then to drive it into commercial production, initially targeting housing, aiming at developing world markets in particular. 

**Computational Making Research Group**

Director: Terry Knight
The Computational Making research group is articulating a new area of interdisciplinary research on the processes and practices of making across contexts and scales. In recent years, there has been growing interest in materials and material practices, and in “making” and “makers”, usually revolving around digital fabrication. Our work aims to expand the study of making beyond its current bounds. We view making as an improvisational, action-centric, embodied, and situated activity. We examine the potentials of computational theories and techniques for understanding and enhancing making activities. 

**Digital Design and Fabrication**

Principal researcher: Larry Sass
The Digital Design and Fabrication group is a center for education and research in areas of rapid prototyping and CAD/CAM fabrication for architects and designers. The group engages faculty, students and staff in research focused on the relationship between design computing and physical output used for design representation and reflection.

**Digital Structures**

a research group at MIT working at the interface of architecture, structural engineering, and computation. Digital Sructures focuses on the synthetic integration of creative and technical goals in the design and fabrication of buildings, bridges, and other large-scale structures. The group is particularly interested in how digital techniques and tools can play an unexpected, collaborative role in these processes. Led by Professor Caitlin Mueller, the group is based in MIT’s Building Technology Program in the Department of Architecture, and also includes contributors from Civil and Environmental Engineering, and the Center for Computational Engineering.


**Shape Grammars**

Principal researchers: George Stiny, Terry Knight, Takehiko Nagakura
This group is engaged in a broad range of work on Shape Grammars, a visual and generative system for creating and describing designs on multiple levels. Work on shape and shape representation at the theoretical level aims at a new computational basis for design. Work on practical applications focuses on the potential of shape grammars in stylistic analysis and in the creative design process. Faculty and students are also exploring the use and development of digital and web-based technologies, computer software, and remote collaboration for supporting shape grammar applications.
